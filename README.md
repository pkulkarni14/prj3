# Project Description
The Chat Server is a multi-threaded TCP server application designed to handle real-time chat functionalities. It supports multiple clients simultaneously, allowing them to communicate with each other through messages. Each client has a unique ID and username, and the server logs events such as client connections, disconnections, and message broadcasts. This project demonstrates concepts like sockets, threading, concurrency, and signal handling in C.
